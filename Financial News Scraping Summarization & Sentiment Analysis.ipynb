       "'(Bloomberg) -- AIA Group Ltd. has agreed to acquire a stake in China Post Life Insurance Co. for about 12 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) to bolster its China expansion. The Hong Kong-based insurance giant will buy a 24.99% stake in China Post Life, subject to regulatory approvals, AIA said in a filing to the Hong Kong exchange on Tuesday. AIA closed 0.8% higher at HK$96.5 in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The deal marks AIA’s second effort this year to boost its distribution network in the world’s most populous nation. AIA is accelerating expansion in mainland China as Covid travel restrictions continue to curb sales of insurance to Chinese visitors, previously a key driver for its Hong Kong unit. Mainland China has eclipsed Hong Kong as the largest contributor of new business value for the insurer. China Post Life, a subsidiary of China Post Group Co., is a bank-affiliated life insurer focusing on the mass-affluent market in China. It has access to a retail distribution network of around 40,000 financial outlets in the country and more than 600 million retail customers. The group’s banking arm has more outlets than its second- and third-placed peers combined, Daiwa Capital Markets analysts led by Leon Qi wrote in a Tuesday note. “We see the investment as a good move of AIA Group to tap into unexplored customer segments and regions currently not touched by AIA China,” Citigroup Inc. analyst Michelle Ma wrote in a note. China Post Life’s focus on a population segment a touch less affluent will help expand the clientele of AIA’s China unit, she added. The deal will provide rapid access to rural China, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steven Lam wrote in a note late Tuesday. The value of the proposed investment represents 1.34 times China Post Life’s book value on a pre-money basis as of the end of 2020, the company said. Value of new business for China Post Life was about $269 million last year. Read more: China Post Life Is Said to Seek $2.2 Billion in Stake Sale The valuation looks high compared with smaller peers listed on China’s domestic stock market and China Post Life’s low solvency ratio, Lam said. Still, it is manageable for AIA, which has a strong solvency position and cash surplus. The price tag only represents about 2.9% of AIA’s shareholder’s equity at the end of 2020, Frank Yuen, senior analyst at Moody’s Investors'"

       "{'GME': [\"As trading platforms like Robinhood create a rise in retail investor market participation and spark a renewed interest in shares of companies dubbed “meme stocks” like GameStop (GME), BlackBerry (BB), and AMC (AMC), the world of finance is seeing an intersection with the social media sphere. “What you're seeing is a much larger trend here,” Alexis Ohanian, founder of venture capital firm Seven Seven Six and co-founder of Reddit, told Yahoo Finance Live. “It is the intersection of community and capital. It's the intersection of social media and finance.” With online communities such as Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets fueling the meme stock craze, the movement has dismissed concerns of market manipulation. Jaime Rogozinski, who founded the subreddit in 2012, says he did it looking for a more active way to trade investment ideas within a community. The forum now boasts a community of over 10.6 million subscribers. According to Ohanian, it is this sense of community and ease of communication, in tandem with a more accessible user experience for consumers, that has enabled this new era of trading to arise. “At the end of the day now, the user experience—and that's the story of all this—the user experience keeps getting better and better and better for consumers,” Ohanian said. “And so naturally, consumers are going to gravitate towards things that are delightful, and then they also have things at their disposal they never did before, which is real time communication with their friends.” Ohanian, who is leading a $4 million seed-funding round for the new sports-betting startup Wagr, believes that the meme stock movement has demonstrated an investment opportunity in platforms that combine a sense of community around activities like betting or investing. Wagr is an app that aims to wed social media with the gambling market. In addition, Ohanian believes that the rise of the retail investor and meme stock forums has forged a new path for the future of finance. “I'm making big investments in this space, companies like Wagr, because I believe we're going to see in the next 10 years a whole other architecture for finance that's built\",\n",
       "  'By Dhirendra Tripathi Investing.com – GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) were both in the red in Monday’s premarket trading as the dust settled over the rebalancing of the Russell indices. Both stocks were down close to 1%. GameStop has moved to the Russell 1000 index while AMC stayed in the Russell 2000 benchmark. The changes in indices are effective today. While the progress of the video game retailer to the larger index was a near certainty, there were still doubts over the inclusion of the multiplex chain owner.\\xa0 GameStop, which is trying to reinvent itself as a digital-first distributor of games and related equipment, is the original meme stock. AMC, another stock challenged by changing consumer behavior patterns, joined it in a market frenzy that added billions of dollars in their market cap in the first half of the year. While AMC was badly hit by the closure of its theaters during the pandemic, its outlook has brightened as the U.S. has gradually lifted restrictions on public gatherings. Action movie \"F9\", starring Vin Diesel- and Charlize Theron, generated $70 million in box office sales at the weekend, the best movie debut since the start of the pandemic. F9 was made by Universal, a Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) subsidiary, collected $70 million over the weekend. Investment managers and institutional investors use Russell indexes as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Approximately $10.6 trillion in assets are benchmarked against Russell’s U.S. indexes. Russell indexes are part of FTSE Russell, a leading global index provider.

GME stock was up 26% in the last five trading sessions and is currently trading at a market cap of US$15.7 billion. GameStop’s short volume ratio is 22%, which indicates there is some room for retail traders to initiate a short squeeze. GameStop was one of the leading companies for gaming enthusiasts, and it successfully built a competitive advantage over time. Gamers could purchase video games and refurbished hardware as well as trade games at GameStop. However, the shift towards digital gaming made GameStop somewhat irrelevant, driving its revenue lower at an alarming rate. GME reported sales of US$9.22 billion in fiscal 2018, and it fell to US$5.09 billion in fiscal 2021. While analysts expect sales to rise by 5.3% to US$5.36 billion in 2022, it’s forecast to decline by 3.6% to US$5.17 billion in 2023. Comparatively, GME is expected to improve its loss per share from US$2.14 in fiscal 2021 to US$0.53 in fiscal 2023. It means that GME stock is trading at a forward price-to-sales multiple of over three, which is steep for a company that is grappling with tepid sales and negative profit margins. Its price-to-book ratio is also sky high at 33. Wall Street remains bearish on GameStop stock and has a 12-month average price target of US$48, which is significantly lower than its current trading price of US$222. For long-term growth investors, Shopify (TSX:SHOP)(NYSE:SHOP) is a stock that has the potential to derive exponential gains. SHOP stock has been on an absolute tear since it went public and has gained 4,740% in the last six years. Shopify is Canada’s largest company in terms of market cap, and it continues to experience stellar growth. In Q1 of 2021, Shopify’s revenue surged 110% year over year. Comparatively, its adjusted earnings per share rose to US$2.01 from US$0.19 in the prior-year period. Shopify CFO Amy Shapero said, “Shopify’s momentum continued into 2021 as digital commerce tailwinds remained strong and merchants took advantage of the range',\n",

       "  'Investors in GameStop Corp. GME need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 16, 2021 $30.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GameStop shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GameStop is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Top 10% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 65 cents per share to a loss of 73 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about GameStop right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- The Russell Reconstitution is a big deal every year, but this time, potential changes for GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. make it interesting for a broader swath of investors than normal. The annual reconstitution of Russell’s U.S. family of indexes accounts for market changes in the previous year, and it affects more than $10.6 trillion in investor assets benchmarked to, or invested in, products based on the Russell U.S. Indexes, according to its website. Trading volumes on U.S. exchanges also tend to be among the heaviest of the year around the event. Will AMC and GameStop be moved into the large-cap Russell 1000 from the small-cap Russell 2000? The key date was May 7. The reconstitution ranks and market cap breaks for the Russell Indexes are determined based on information available on rank day -- this year, May 7 -- according to Catherine Yoshimoto, FTSE Russell’s director of product management. An existing Russell 2000 index member would have had to have a total market cap exceeding $7.3 billion in order to move into the Russell 1000 index, she said. Going by that, AMC -- with a market cap of $4.28 billion on May 7 -- would fall short of inclusion, while GameStop and its $11.97 billion market cap would make it. As of Friday’s close, after big rallies in the last month, GameStop had a market capitalization of $18.4 billion. AMC’s is $24.6 billion. The reconstitution process is pretty formulaic: There’s a whole cottage industry of analysts who predict changes to the indexes in advance with high accuracy. A preliminary ranking is done by Russell on May 7. The first round of information was announced on Friday, with the preliminary list of additions and deletions from the Russell 3000 (that’s a combination of the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000). Here are key quotes from Friday’s press release: “The market capitalization breakpoint which separates companies in the U.S. large-cap Russell 1000 Index and companies in the U.S. small-cap Russell 2000 Index increased by 73% from $3.0 billion in 2020 to $5.2 billion for 2021.”“The closely-watched final index',\n",

       "  'What it takes to mine crypto coins and how feasible is it to make it a home enterprise  The GameStop (NYSE: GME) share price has surged by nearly 5,500% over the past 12 months. Investors and traders have piled into the stock as it’s continued to push higher. What started as an online phenomenon has grown into something bigger. Investors and traders from all walks of life are trying to capitalise on what’s become one of the most talked-about companies on the New York Stock Exchange. Unfortunately, the company’s fundamentals haven’t matched up to its staggering share price performance so far. In its 2021 financial year, the organisation reported revenues of $5.1bn and a loss of $215m. Before the recent rally, the GameStop (GME) share price had been under pressure for years. The company, which owned a large brick-and-mortar retail estate, was struggling to compete with online peers. However, last year was a bit of a watershed for the group. As the pandemic raged around the world and the company’s stores suffered yet more disruption, management took a decisive step to move more business online. It’s taken several other steps to become more forward-thinking. It’s hired several new executives including Amazon.com executive Elliott Wilke as chief growth officer and Ryan Cohen, the entrepreneur who built Chewy.com into a pet supply giant and sold it for more than $3bn. In addition, rumours suggest Cohen will bring in e-commerce experts with the goal of transforming GameStop into a retailer fit for the 21st century. As well as these initiatives, the GameStop share price received a boost when it emerged that the company was looking to branch into the worlds of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies. Even though some analysts believe the recent rally in GameStop shares is nothing but speculation, I can see a scenario where the stock continues to move higher. At the time of writing, it’s trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 4. Online retailer Etsy, which has a similar market capitalisation, is trading at a P/S ratio of 10.

       "  \"Gamestop has tapped two former Amazon executives as CEO and CFO. Wedbush Senior Analyst Michael Pachter joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. - Let's turn our attention now to shares of GameStop. It is sliding fast in this session, down nearly 13% right now after the company announced an overhaul at the top. Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen voted in as the company's new chairman as expected yesterday. Also, two former Amazon executives named to key positions-- former Amazon Australia Chief Matt Furlong was appointed as the CEO while 17-year Amazon veteran Mike Recupero named chief financial officer. This coming on a day when they, of course, reported their quarterly earnings. The company did post a loss per share of $.45. But sales did rise about 25% in the first quarter. Certainly, the stock is sliding on the company failing to provide an outlook for the year, saying they may sell as many as 5 million shares as well. Let's bring in Michael Pachter, Wedbush Senior Analyst. And, Michael, you've got a 12-month price target of $50 a share. So we're looking at $262 right now where it's trading. What do you make of the shake-up at the top when-- when you think about the fundamentals here and where GameStop is headed? You've got a lot of Amazon veterans in there now. MICHAEL PACHTER: Yeah, we don't know where GameStop is headed. But it's clear that they intend to remake themselves as an [? Amazon-lite. ?] And, you know, Ryan Cohen promised investors a strategy back in mid-January. It's been nearly five months, and we haven't seen that yet. So I actually think the stock is probably down more on lack of, you know, an unveil of their new strategy than anything else. Possibly the Reddit Raiders-- you know, the retail investors-- wanted to see somebody from Coinbase or somebody from some cannabis supplier-- something transformational-- take over as CEO. And we got more of the same. And as a fundamental research analyst, I am A-OK with hiring people from Amazon, especially from the e-commerce division. So these are good people.\",\n",
       "  'What it takes to mine crypto coins and how feasible is it to make it a home enterprise  The GameStop (NYSE:GME) share price continues to defy expectations. Over the last 12 months, even with the high level of volatility, the stock is up nearly 4,600%. And just last week, it continued its upward trajectory, jumping by a further 10% in the first hours of trading on Tuesday. What caused this recent surge? And could it be that GameStop is a worthwhile long-term investment for my portfolio? Let’s take a closer look. The pandemic decimated a large portion of the retail industry. And for GameStop, it proved to be a complete catastrophe. But the video games retailer was in a struggling position long before Covid-19 entered the picture. After all, with most gamers buying and downloading their games digitally, the need for GameStop’s physical stores has been dwindling. In an attempt to save the business, Ryan Cohen, the co-founder of the online pet food business Chewy, has been brought on as the new chairman of the board. His vision is to transform the company into the Amazon of gaming. Needless to say, that’s quite a challenge. Although it’s worth noting that he managed to pull off something similar for Chewy. Consequently, investors seem to have faith in this new leadership. If Cohen succeeds, then the currently overvalued GME share price may actually be justified. And now that the firm has just finished raising over $1.1bn through the sale of five million shares, its balance sheet has been flooded with cash to fund this enterprise. That appears to be why the GME share price shot up last week. The last time I looked at this business, the financials were quite concerning. Since then, the company’s first-quarter earnings report for 2021 has been published. And there are some encouraging signs of a potential turnaround. Using previously raised capital from shareholders and proceeds from closing stores, long-term debt has been completely eliminated. Meanwhile, this latest round of funding has significantly improved the liquidity position of the business. In other words, GameStop shouldn’t have'],\n",

       "  'By Sam Nussey and Shinji Kitamura TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp sold its stake in electric car maker Tesla Inc for about 400 billion yen ($3.61 billion) in the year ended March, a spokesperson for the Japanese company said on Friday. The sale comes as the bicycles-to-hair dryers conglomerate is seeking to reduce its dependence on Tesla and raise cash for growth investment. Panasonic\\'s battery business is dominated by Elon Musk\\'s Tesla, but the two firms have had a tense relationship at times. Panasonic bought 1.4 million Tesla shares at $21.15 each in 2010 for about $30 million. That stake was worth $730 million at the end of March 2020. The shares have gained almost seven fold since then and closed up 3.5% at $679.82 apiece on Thursday. \"The impact of crypto assets may have pushed Tesla\\'s share price above its intrinsic value, making it a good time to sell,\" said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. Musk said in February his firm bought bitcoin and would take payment in the cryptocurrency, a decision he later reversed, and his comments on Twitter drive swings in the price of such assets. While Panasonic gave financial backing to Tesla when it was smaller, the automaker\\'s expansion means there\\'s no need for capital ties, Yasuda added. Panasonic\\'s shares closed up 4.9% on Friday in the biggest such move since January. The stake sale will not affect the partnership with Tesla, the Panasonic spokesperson said, and was made as part of a review of shareholdings in line with corporate governance guidelines. The sale comes as the automaker is diversifying its own battery supply chain.

The regulator in China calls it a product recall. An investigation found that the system could be activated accidentally and lead to the vehicle accelerating unexpectedly. The safety software update targets more than 285,000 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles produced between December 2019 and June 2021. More than 90% of those vehicles were manufactured at Tesla’s China plant in Shanghai. The update will fix the problem without requiring drivers to go to a dealer. “Tesla will continue to improve safety in strict accordance with national requirements,” the report quoted Tesla as saying in a Weibo post. A longtime darling brand in China, Tesla has recently run into product quality-related headaches in the country. In February, for instance, Chinese authorities summoned the company over complaints about safety issues. In April, a customer used the Auto Shanghai event to protest against an alleged braking problem on Tesla vehicles. (See Tesla stock chart on TipRanks).

The State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement on Saturday that the action involves 211,256 locally produced Model 3 vehicles and 35,665 imported ones, as well as 38,599 China-made Model Ys. The California-based carmaker only began deliveries of the Model Y sports-utility vehicle in January, so the recall will affect pretty much every driver who bought one. The Chinese agency said the vehicles’ autopilot systems can be activated automatically, potentially leading to crashes from sudden acceleration. In most cases, the fix should be able to be made remotely with an online update to the cars’ active cruise control feature. Tesla will upgrade the software for free. While Tesla apologized via its official customer support account on Weibo, saying that it will “continue to improve safety in strict accordance with national requirements,” the recall tops a string of embarrassing setbacks for the company in China. A protest that went viral at the Shanghai auto show in mid-April and a spate of crashes has soured public opinion toward the EV pioneer and a few local governments and official institutions are reviewing Tesla ownership among their staff, citing concerns the cars pose security risks.

Tesla immediately moved to reassure authorities, saying any data collected in China is stored locally. That the required software fix impacts Tesla’s Model Y is especially unfortunate. The SUV crossover, which has a driving range of up to 594 kilometers (369 miles), was seen as enabling Tesla to target a much bigger customer base in the world’s biggest market for EVs and cars overall.

       "  'The company Tesla (TSLA) booted from the S&P 500 index has vastly outperformed the electric automaker by a “stupendous margin,” analysts at Research Affiliates pointed out this week. Tesla entered the S&P 500 to great fanfare on Dec. 21, 2020, in a rebalance of the index. It surged well over 20% in its first month, but since then has fallen, standing now with gains of about 5%, lagging the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) near-16% gain in that same timeframe. Tesla’s entry meant one company had to leave, as the S&P 500 does not become the S&P 501 when a new company joins the club. To make room, S&P had to kick out Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) from the index, but since that December 2020 rebalance, the company’s stock spiked almost 60% — and though it went down still stands around 40% higher than it did when it got the boot. According to analysis from Research Affiliates\\' Rob Arnott, Vitali Kalesnik, and Lillian Wu, Apartment Investment and Management, this pattern is not uncommon. Frequently, additions to the index underperform and removed companies often do very well, the authors wrote in a research note. \"Traditional cap-weighted indices routinely buy high and sell low when the index rebalances resulting in substantial hidden costs to investors who track the index,” the note said. “The December 2020 S&P 500 rebalance out of AIV and into TSLA cost investors 41 [basis points] in the first six months, and the cost may go higher.” In their view, a struggling stock getting kicked out of the index during a rebalancing means getting the axe at a low point. On the other side, a hot new stock getting added to the index is trading at a high point. The authors pointed out that though index investing is passive, the actual indexes aren’t necessarily passive as the decisions on which companies to include in the S&P 500 is controlled by a committee. And the index changes to compensate for companies’ valuations and new entrants periodically, not automatically. An investor who had $100,000 in, say, an S&P 500 index fund on',\n",
       "  \"Tesla (TSLA) closed the most recent trading day at $680.76, moving -1.16% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.03%. Prior to today's trading, shares of the electric car maker had gained 10.16% over the past month. This has outpaced the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 7.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.12% in that time. Wall Street will be looking for positivity from TSLA as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect TSLA to post earnings of $0.89 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 102.27%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $11.38 billion, up 88.57% from the year-ago period. Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.32 per share and revenue of $49.39 billion. These totals would mark changes of +92.86% and +56.61%, respectively, from last year. Any recent changes to analyst estimates for TSLA should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability. Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system. Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. TSLA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Valuation is also important, so investors should note that TSLA has a Forward P/E ratio of 159.32 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.07. Meanwhile, TSLA's PEG ratio is currently 4.61. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.\"],\n",

Vinnik, an alleged operator of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e, was sentenced last December on the charge of money-laundering. Other charges, including “extortion, conspiracy and harming automatic data-processing systems,” were dropped at the time of sentencing. The U.S. Department of Justice named him as a mastermind behind one of the first cryptocurrency exchanges, BTC-e, and indicted him on allegations of “computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials and narcotics distribution rings.” Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017 at the behest of the U.S., prompting a three-way battle amongst France, Russia and the U.S. for his extradition with France ultimately winning. According to TASS, Vinnik was successful in one aspect this week: The court exempted him from a fine of 100,000 euros (USD $119.4 million). Prosecutors had sought a reduction of the amount due to concerns that Vinnik could not pay it.

Coinbase was the most complained-about crypto digital wallet in the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau’s complaint database, according to a study done by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, with the volume of filings — albeit starting at a low level — accelerating this year.\\xa0 “Coinbase should be investigating consumer complaints in a timely manner, [and] it should be hiring staff to answer the phone,\" Ed Mierzwinski, senior director of the federal consumer program at U.S. Public Interest Research Group, told Yahoo Money. \"Consumers say it isn\\'t doing either.” Since November 2019 through December 2020, Coinbase received just seven \"mobile wallet\" complaints each year. But starting this year through April, consumers filed more than five times that average each month, hitting a high of 62 in March. The increase follows the meteoric rise in value of many digital coins.\\xa0\\xa0 Most complaints revolved around issues managing, opening, and closing individual mobile wallet accounts. According to U.S. PIRG, of the Coinbase complaints that included narratives, 25% referenced bitcoin, 6% noted ethereum, and 6% mentioned litecoin.

Virgin Galactic\\'s announcement on Friday that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the company for passenger space flights was certainly good news, but it was still somewhat surprising to see the stock jump 30% higher based on the announcement.  After all, while nothing is a given, FAA approval was assumed and expectations that Virgin Galactic was back on schedule after a series of setbacks was a big reason the stock had rallied 40% higher in May.

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- Strategists are struggling to see a turnaround ahead for Bitcoin, at least for now, as the digital coin looks to consolidate above the $30,000 level. The near-term setup is “challenging,” a JPMorgan Chase & Co. team including Josh Younger and Veronica Mejia Bustamante wrote in a note Friday, while Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC’s David Grider recommended reducing risk or buying some protection. The JPMorgan team said blockchain data suggests recent cryptocurrency sales were made to cover losses and that “there is likely still an overhang of underwater positions which need to be cleared through the market.” Bitcoin has roughly halved from a peak near $65,000 in April, hurt by a cryptocurrency clampdown in China, tightening regulatory scrutiny elsewhere and concerns that the servers underpinning the virtual coin consume too much energy. The prospect of reduced emergency stimulus amid the recovery from the pandemic may also be an obstacle for the most speculative investments. Still, the JPMorgan strategists pointed to stability in the Bitcoin futures market as a positive factor, alongside the possibility of increased production costs as China’s crackdown pushes Bitcoin mining abroad. Some researchers argue the marginal production cost plays an important role in Bitcoin prices. So while the “cryptocurrency market shows signs that it is not yet healthy, it does also appear to be beginning the process of healing,” they wrote. The largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 6.5% to $33,329 on Sunday, snapping a two-day drop. Other coins rallied too, with Ether up more than 5%. Some chart watchers view the $30,000 level as key for Bitcoin, contending a decline below it could open the way to retreat to $20,000. Grider, lead digital asset strategist at Fundstrat, noted that a large short position has been building again on the crypto exchange Bitfinex -- and said the last time there was a similar situation, negative news out of China took prices lower.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was up 1.6%, trading at $35,249 ($25,433). Despite recovering from a sell off in which its price fell to below $30,000, it still remains far away from its all-time high of $63,000 from earlier in the year. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, was up 8%, trading at $2,158. Cryptos had slumped amid news of regulatory crackdown in China, but since then they have been rising steadily higher. They remain unfazed by news that Britain’s financial watchdog issued a warning to consumers that one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges is not permitted to undertake regulated activities in the UK. Over the weekend the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) ordered Binance Markets to remove all advertising and financial promotions by 30 June. The FT reported that Binance customers are now not able to withdraw or deposit pounds using Faster Payments, one of the main UK payments systems.

He said Britons are still free to buy, sell, and hold crypto on the platform but the FCA has issued an enforcement action against Binance for offering complex products where they shouldn\\'t have. “Investors see the crackdown as a sign that the crypto markets are maturing, and that the company will have to accelerate its process of becoming a regulated exchange, which will likely lead to increased trust among crypto traders,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Ava Trade.',\n",

The cryptocurrency has since rebounded slightly, now holding at a level just above $32,000. Though the news and subsequent crash may have caused short term headaches in the crypto market, China’s crackdown on mining may actually benefit crypto in the long run, according to some experts.\\xa0 “I think it\\'s actually fantastic news for the Bitcoin ecosystem,” Peter Smith, Blockchain.com co-founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance Live. “You\\'re going to see a diversification of mining operations around the world. We\\'ve been seeing that trend over the last two years, as large mines are built in Europe, the U.S., and a variety of other geographic locations—but that trend is going to accelerate hard now.” Smith cited the growing concern of Bitcoin mining becoming too highly concentrated in mainland China as a reason for a positive outlook on the crackdown. He predicts that over the next three to four years, this will yield a net positive for crypto as mining firms sell off their bitcoin and move their operations overseas. Chinese mining firms have already begun planning to shift their businesses abroad, with companies eyeing countries ranging from the U.S. to Kazakhstan. According to Chris Zhu, owner of Chinese mining service platform INBTC, approximately 10% to 20% of miners in China have already initiated their move. \"We spent around ten days getting to Sichuan, only for operations to stop there too,\" Zhu told AFP. \"It\\'s going to be tough to continue here.\" As for what the implications of Beijing’s restrictions on mining will have in terms of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), Smith believes there is not enough available information to make a judgement call. According to him, the “vast majority” of mining operations being built today are powered by some form of clean energy. “You\\'re going to see mining companies start to disclose where they\\'re getting their energy,” Smith added.',\n",

But we do not discuss too often the process behind actually continuing to build the blockchain itself, the mining process that creates digital Bitcoin, digital Ether, so on, so forth.

So let's start with-- let's actually start with what Elon Musk said a few weeks back, and it really started, from my vantage point, kind of outside the crypto space. One of the big internecine fights that I have seen which is, is crypto mining environmentally friendly or unfriendly? And as someone who is operating, you know, mining-- I guess outposting-- just kind of warehouses of a sort-- where do you come down on that issue? And how do you answer, I guess, that kind of question from folks that certainly have it for you? DON VO: Well, actually, what I see is I think Elon Musk is wrong, or maybe he's just setting up, like, a story for his front and his future endeavors into the Bitcoin mining space. But the truth-- the reality is most Bitcoin mining data centers are actually using renewable energy. Like VBit's data centers, we're using hydroelectric power. most of the mines in China, of course, there are some mines that are still using coal power, but a lot of them are using hydro, a lot of them are using solar energy, which are all renewables.
